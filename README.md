Data-driven real estate investment analysis in Madrid using Python &amp; Power BI

# Madrid Real Estate Investment Analysis

## 📍 Overview

This project explores short-term rental investment opportunities in Madrid, Spain using Python and Power BI. By combining Airbnb listings, pricing data from Idealista, and geospatial information, we identify high-yield neighborhoods, occupancy trends, and location-based insights.

> ⚠️ Due to GitHub file size limits `reviews.csv(.gz)` is not included in the repository. You can download it manually from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). ⚠️ The `airbnb.db` SQLite database is also not included — it is automatically created when running the notebooks.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 📊 Data Analysis with Python

- Created SQLite database (`airbnb.db`) using listings, calendar, reviews, and pricing data
- Merged property rental and sales data by district
- Performed exploratory analysis on:
  - Rental price per m²
  - **Occupancy rate** based on actual availability data
  - **Estimated rental yield** calculated as rental income vs. market value
  - Property characteristics (room type, beds, accommodates, etc.)

### 📌 Geospatial & Investment Mapping

- District-level mapping based on latitude/longitude coordinates (GeoJSON not required)
- Distance calculations from Puerta del Sol (city center proxy)
- Identification of high-yield zones and undervalued areas

### 📈 Power BI Dashboard

- Fully interactive Power BI dashboard built from the CSV file `RE_Analysis_Madrid_dataset.csv`
- This file is **generated by running** `RE_Analysis_Madrid_Executive_Summary.ipynb`
- In Power BI:
  - Load the CSV into the data model upon opening
  - Optional: adjust field types or formats in Table View

#### Dashboard features:

- 📈 Investment outlook
- 🏠 Market and property drivers
- 🛏️ Occupancy drivers by property and price
- 📍 Distance to city center vs. rental price and occupancy performance
- 💡 District-level investment outlook

## 💡 Insights

- Highest average yields are found in **Villaverde**, **Puente de Vallecas**, and **San Blas – Canillejas**
- Proximity to city center does **not always** correlate with higher occupancy or price
- Simpler units (fewer beds, entire homes) tend to attract **more consistent bookings**
- **San Blas – Canillejas** offers promising returns at lower purchase cost
